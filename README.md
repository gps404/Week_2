#Sequence LED
Set up each of the 5 pins to output using pinMode with 'for' loop . Made leds blink from left to write (pin 12-16 connected leds from left to right in order)using 'for' loop with increment of count variable begining with 12 and ending with 16.
Leds blink from right to left using 'for' loop with decrement of count variable beginning with 16 and ending with 12 .Used digitalWrite() to set the pin to 5V or 0V which is HIGH and LOW respectively , and delay() to make leds blink slow as to see .
