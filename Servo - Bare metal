#Bare metal servo 
set data direction register B to 1 because bits of 1 is 0000001 which switched PORTB pin 8 to 1 
used for loops giving servo a high volt PORTB=1 to make servo move and a low volt PORTB=0 to make servo stop moving .
Defined a function for delay 
Made Servo only move a bit without potentiometer.
