#Sequence LED
pused pinMode to assign pins to 5 led and ther OUTPUT ( pins 12-16 connected in order from left to right).
used 2 'for' loops .One with an incremnet of count variable for making leds blink from left to right from pin 12 to pin 16.
Second 'for' loop with decrement of count variable from pin 16 to pin 12 for making leds blink from right to left.
Used digitalWrite() inside both for loops to give pin according to count the output along with delay.
